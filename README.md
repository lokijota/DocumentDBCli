# DocumentDBCli
Simple Azure DocumentDB Command Line Interface

Simple command line tool to create some application-level artifacts in Azure DocumentDB. Features include:

- test a connection
- create a database
- create a collection in a database (optionally specifying the throughput in Resource Units)
- insert a json document into a collection
- list all the databases
- list the collections in a database or in all the databases



Note: I've tested the code in several scenarios, but it comes with no warranties.
